Pin 1 is the common heater and cathode ground.  It's the pin that is connected to the little backward "L" shaped tab at the base of the tube.

Looking down on the tube with the pins facing upward: Pins are counted CLOCKWISE...

Pin 6 is the heater positive.  +2.4V, 35mA +/-5mA

You can swap pins 1 and 6 (i.e., swap heater polarity).  It seems to cause the dim dot to switch ends.

Pins 2,3,4,5,7,8,9 are the anodes +25V, 4-10mA?
